1. after creating a new repository in Github; copy the https link of it
and use the clone command in your terminal:
git clone https://   .git
2.ls in the working directory should shows you the repository file
3. cd to go to the repository
4. git status >>> to show you the status of your local?
5. git add file >>> to add the changes into the staging area
6. git commit -m "any notes about the changes that you want a snapshot of" 
>> this is to do the snapshot; to transfer it to repository.
7. now you cannot see this in the remote repository; so you need 
git push
